    <h2>Preparing</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Prepare the Pancakes: Whisk together flour, baking powder, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl until combined. Add buttermilk, brown sugar, egg, and vanilla; stir until just combined. Stir in carrots and melted butter until just combined. Set aside.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Prepare the Frosting: In a medium bowl, whisk together cream cheese, milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Set aside.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Prepare the Topping: In a small bowl, stir together raisins, pecans, coconut, and ginger, if desired. Set aside.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium. Grease skillet or griddle with butter.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Working in batches, scoop 1/4 cup batter per pancake into the skillet, being sure not to overcrowd skillet. Cook until bubbles begin to form on surface of pancakes and edges look dry, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip, and cook until fluffy and slightly firm, about 1 minute. Repeat with remaining batter, adding butter and adjusting heat as needed.</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Divide pancakes evenly among 4 plates. Drizzle Pancakes evenly with Frosting, and sprinkle evenly with Topping.</p>
