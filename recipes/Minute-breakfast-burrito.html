    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Filled scrambled eggs, shredded cheese, and a bright, fresh avocado-tomato salsa, these breakfast burritos are one of my kids’ most requested breakfast-for-dinner dishes. The inspiration for the recipe comes from Lake Anne Market, a hidden-gem bodega in my hometown of Heston, Virginia. If you’re making these for kids, consider omitting or reducing the jalapeño pepper (my kids actually prefer the burritos with no salsa at all)
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons salsa</li>
    <li>1 slice reduced-fat American cheese</li>
    <li>1 tortilla</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Preparing</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Spray a cereal bowl with nonstick cooking spray. Crack the eggs into the bowl, add the salsa, and stir. Microwave on high for 1 minute, stir, and cook for another minute or until the mixture firms up.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Place the cheese in the center of the tortilla and top it with the egg mixture. Wrap it all up like a burrito and head for the car.</p>
